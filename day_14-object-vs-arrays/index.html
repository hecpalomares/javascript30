  <title>Day14: JS Reference VS Copy</title>
</head>
<body>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //these are coppied as value
    let name = 'hector';
    let name2 = name;
    name = 'gerardo';

    // Let's say we have an array //this are coppied as a reference
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Mike';

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way slice method
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Hector',
        age: 25
    }
    // and think we make a copy: THIS OVERRIDES THE OBJECT
    const cap = person;
    cap.name = "Capi Capi";

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread. This is shallow copy
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.name = "Capitan Number Three";

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const me = {
        name: 'Hector',
        age: 25,
        links: {
            news: 'medium.com',
            videos: 'vimeo.com'
        }
    };

    //Only one deeper level
    const devMe = Object.assign({}, me);

    //Pass an object to json stringify and that would made a string. And then parse it back to a object. Poor mans deep clone but works for any levels.
    const devMe2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(me));
